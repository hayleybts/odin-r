        <p>There are days when we get lazy and that is when we create things like MAGGI Noodles Easy-Peasy. But, if you think we compromised on this one, you are wrong – you can never go wrong with your favourite MAGGI Noodles because there is #NothingLikeMAGGI! It’s amazing how tomatoes, onions, green peas and some cumin seeds, can make so much of a difference and the best part is – It’s as easy as one, two, three! To add a Kasoori Twist to your Easy-Peasy MAGGI,
             just add ½ a teaspoon of kasoori methi to the noodles while cooking!</p>
